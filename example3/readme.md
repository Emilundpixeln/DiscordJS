These files can be used with chrome DevTools local override feature to hook into the spotify
controller object. To do this you need to goto `https://open.spotify.com/`, open DevTools, under sources select this
folder for local overrides and reload the page while DevTools are open.
This allows programmticaly starting playback, pausing and volume control via the 
global `sp_interact` object.

It can also read playback data on a websocket generated by example3.ts and synchronize playback.
Use `sp_interact.start_sync()` to start.
